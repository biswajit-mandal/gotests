`gotests` generates Go test functions from the given source code.

Given `A.go` file, it analyzes test functions in `A_test.go` and adds test functions which are not defined in that file. For example, if a function `DoSomething()` is defined in `A.go` but `TestDoSomething()` is not in `A_test.go`, then it adds that function to `A_test.go`. By default, it only checks the exported functions (its name starts with upper case). Given a directory, it operates on all `*.go` files in that directory. By default, `gotests` prints the updated test sources to standard output.

## Editor integration

`gotests` works well with your favorite editor capable of running an external tool like `gofmt` does. The following demo shows using `gotests` from [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/). The left display shows the source codes (`A.go`) and the right shows test source codes (`A_test.go`). It generates and adds test functions on the right codes,

`gotests.el` used by this demo is available in [`editor/emacs`](/editor/emacs) directory (I'm not good at emacs package development. So this plugin should not well written. If you are good at emacs plugin please send PR ðŸ™‡ ).

A plugin PR for the other editor is welcome.

## Install

To install, use `go get`:

```bash
$ go get -u github.com/tcnksm/gotests
```

## Usage

The usage:

```bash
gotests [options] PATH ...
```

Available options:

```bash
-diff, -d      Display diffs instead of rewriting files.

-write, -w     Write result to target file instead of stdout.
               For example, if source file name is 'A.go', target
               file would be 'A_test.go'.

-list, -l      List test files to be updated/generated.

-i             Include unexport function/method for generating target.

-reverse, -r   (experimental) Allow to input test file instead of source file.
               By default, gotests expects source file PATH provided.
               With this flag, the test file can be given. 
               For example, you can provide 'A_test.go' instead of 'A.go'.
               This flag is useful for editor integration.
```

## Rule

The followings are the current basic rule of how to generate test functions, 

- Test functions for `A.go` are added to `A_test.go`
- Generating test function name of function is `Test{{ title .Name }}` 
- Generating test function name of method is `Test{{ title .ReceiverTypeName }}_{{ title .Name }}`

(In future, this rule will be configurable from command line option)
